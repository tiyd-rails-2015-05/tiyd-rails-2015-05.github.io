## Welcome!

Welcome to the The Iron Yard in Durham!  Congratulations on being accepted, and for deciding to take on such an intense program.  The next three months will be exciting, exhausting, and empowering.  I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.

You're probably wondering what you're in for (or are at least wondering something about me), and while I can't answer all of your questions in this format, I think we'll cover a lot.  First, for those who want a broad, hand-wavy sense of what I aim for, feel free to read [some thoughts on my teaching goals](/syllabus/values.html).  

The remainder of this site gets down to brass tacks.  Here you'll find references and resources for you to use before, during, and after the class. If I missed something, please let me know!
