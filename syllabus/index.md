* More NoSQL Options

### Week 10

During this week, you will be pitching your final project ideas, forming groups,
and getting feedback. In ad hoc discussions, we will discuss software development
principles. You should be comfortable with:

* Breaking up features into distinct tasks
* Estimating the size of programming tasks
* Using Agile development to run a project

### Weeks 11-12

You will be working on your final project and presentation during this time.

## Assignments

### In-lecture exercises

During breaks in the lecture, you will be given exercises for practicing the content you've just learned.  Sometimes I'll give you a set of tests, and you'll be asked to write code to make them pass.  Other times you'll be given a blank slate to start from.  In most cases, you won't have time to finish the exercises before I ask you to stop and throw away what you've done.  This is normal (if not disconcerting) and will be somewhat liberating by the end.

### Nightly Assignments

After classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, you'll be given a longer assignment.  You'll work on these during the lab time that afternoon, and it's expected that you won't finish them by 5pm.  You'll be asked to work on these as individuals, and you'll usually be expected to write tests first.

### Weekly Assignments

After classes on Thursdays, you'll be given a substantially longer assignment.  You'll usually work on these assignments in pairs (which we'll assign for you), and you'll occasionally be working with students from other courses.  Lab time on Thursday afternoon and all day Friday will be dedicated to helping you with these.  As above, we expect that you won't finish these by 5pm on Friday, and you'll be expected to write tests first.

### Final Project

During the last three weeks of the course, you will be working on your capstone
project, putting all you've learned into practice. You will be working with a
group of 2-4 people on your project, and these groups CAN include students from
the other two courses. Projects that span multiple courses typically turn out
the best.

During week 10, you'll present your idea for a final project and get feedback,
helping you scope the project. During weeks 11 and 12, you'll spend all of your
time working on this project. We will have occasional lecture time, but it will
be tailored to what you need to know for your project and will be optional.

This project must use Rails. If you are not planning to spend much time on the
visual user interface, I _highly_ suggest working with someone from another
class to make your project visually appealing.

## Policies

### Absence policy

You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in the job placement
program is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any lectures, as we will be moving very
fast.

### Late homework policy

Your homework is due by 6 AM on the day it is due. After that, it is late.  If
you regularly turn in your assignments late, your enrollment in the job placement
program is forfeit.

I would rather see a solid incomplete attempt on time than a complete assignment
late. Solid incomplete attempts turned in on time are not considered late.

### Honor code

You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to
you, including open-source code, but copy-pasting open-source code is
prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger
project.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job
placement or explusion.

## Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of
a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere
to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to
teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us, the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class,
HipChat, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by talking to your teacher. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your
teacher, speak with any Iron Yard teacher or campus director.

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your
colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard
community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
people outside the Iron Yard community.

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult
or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and
sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class.
This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* <p>Repeated harassment of others.
In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>

* **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social
and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is
important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its
varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have
different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help
resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
