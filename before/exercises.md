## Prework

We don't believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn't be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and this work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

### Objectives

The following are the learning objectives for the prework. Although only a subset are technically "programming" skills, they are crucially important to success both during the class and on the job.

The prework should help you start to:

1. Reflect on your own mental processes, preferences, and struggles
1. Communicate information about yourself and about technical accomplishments clearly
1. Learn in contexts that aren't necessarily suited to your primary learning style
1. Adopt workflows used by professional developers
1. Acquire new skills at a rapid pace

Not surprisingly, you will continue to work towards these objectives throughout the course.

### Topic 1: Your Brain

* Visual vs auditory learners
* Top-down thinkers vs Bottom-up thinkers
* [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
* Send in Survey

### Topic 2: Programming (in general)

* Make sure you sent in that survey from topic 1
* Eloquent JS first few chapters

### Topic 3: Ruby

* Try Ruby?

### Topic 4: The Command Line

The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if you've never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

1. Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-t...)
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environmen...)
1. Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li...)

### Topic 5: Git

* Try Git

### Conclusion

* Send in second survey


## Optional Material

The following exercises are not required! However, if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources:

* [Ruby on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
* [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/)
* [Getting Started - Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
* [the Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.com) by Michael Hartl. Although it doesn't go into depth on too many topics, it's a great overview, it gets you coding, and the book is free to read online. Please note, though, that he uses a few different development tools in the book than we'll use in the class (he uses Cloud9 for writing code while we'll use Atom; he uses Bitbucket for source code while we'll use Github).  If possible, use the tools we've asked you to install on the [Mac Setup page](setup.html). If this causes confusion, let me know and I'll assist.
