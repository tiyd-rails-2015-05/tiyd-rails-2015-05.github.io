## Prework

We don't believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn't be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and this work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

### Objectives

The following are the learning objectives for the prework. Although only a subset are technically "programming" skills, they are crucially important to success both during the class and on the job.

The prework should assure us that you can:

1. Reflect on your own mental processes, preferences, and struggles
1. Communicate information about yourself and about technical accomplishments clearly
1. Manage your learning time effectively (and avoid procrastination)
1. Adopt workflows used by professional developers
1. Acquire new skills at a rapid pace

Not surprisingly, you will continue to work towards these objectives throughout the course.

### Topic 1: Your Brain

* [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
* [Top-down thinkers vs Bottom-up thinkers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) - Read from the top down through the "Programming" section (2.2) of this page.
* [Visual/auditory/tactile/etc learning styles](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/08/29/139973743/think-youre-an-auditory-or-visual-learner-scientists-say-its-unlikely)

After reading these articles, please fill out the following survey:

* [Prework Survey 1](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E3lffSuuTDCRZmBoYgW51_EVSfrXeAEZIou9t31unCo/viewform?usp=send_form)

### Topic 2: Programming (in general)

Before we dive into Ruby proper, let's get a primer on some fundamental programming concepts.  We're going to read the first few chapters in a book on JavaScript (sadly, no similarly awesome introduction exists in a book on Ruby).  The last chapter you'll be reading has a bit of JavaScript syntax, so I apologize for the differences that you'll be seeing soon.

* First, make sure you sent in that survey from topic 1!
* Read the introduction and first two chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
  * No need to buy the book; just scroll down a bit and you'll see links to the chapters.
  * No need to do the exercises; just read.

### Topic 3: Ruby

Okay, great.  Now that some fundamentals are out of the way, let's look at Ruby syntax a bit.

* Complete the first four levels of [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/).
* Complete [Codecademy's Ruby track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) through "Arrays and Hashes."

Optionally, if you want to, you can keep going on Codecademy's.  My opinion is that it is not very helpful past the basics.  Once the concepts get harder, we tend to just make type what they want us to rather than really getting the concepts.  I think our immersive class is better for that.

### Topic 4: The Command Line

It's time now to go beyond the work of programming and talk about the tools that make it possible for us to program.  I apologize, but although this is fundamental to what we do, it's going to get a bit more technical.

The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Especially if you've never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

In order to complete some of these tasks, you will need to register for an account with Treehouse. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough to finish the required courses), and is $25/month after the trial.

1. Read [this article](http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/)
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-t...)
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environmen...)
1. Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-li...)


### Topic 5: Git and GitHub

Okay.  Now you know how to make files, folders, etc,

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable.

* Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
* Do the [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) Exercises
* Read some of the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/):
  * Hello World
  * Getting Your Project on GitHub
  * Understanding the GitHub flow
  * Forking Projects
  * Mastering Markdown

### Topic 6: HTML/CSS

HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we will only be spending about a week on HTML and CSS, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.

Complete the Codecademy course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web. This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience.

Then, start working through http://learn.shayhowe.com/, if you have time.  

# Typing
Believe it or not, *a lot* of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try http://www.keybr.com/). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io. Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.

### Conclusion

Once you have finished the prework given above,

* Send in second survey


### Optional Material

The following exercises are not required! However, if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources.

* [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/)
* [the Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.com) by Michael Hartl. Although it doesn't go into depth on too many topics, it's a great overview, it gets you coding, and the book is free to read online. Please note, though, that he uses a few different development tools in the book than we'll use in the class (he uses Cloud9 for writing code while we'll use Atom; he uses Bitbucket for source code while we'll use GitHub).  If possible, use the tools we've asked you to install on the [Mac Setup page](setup.html). If this causes confusion, let me know and I'll assist.
