## Optional Material

The following exercises are not required! However, if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources:

* [Ruby on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
* [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/)
* [Getting Started - Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
* [the Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.com) by Michael Hartl. Although it doesn't go into depth on too many topics, it's a great overview, it gets you coding, and the book is free to read online. Please note, though, that he uses a few different development tools in the book than we'll use in the class (he uses Cloud9 for writing code while we'll use Atom; he uses Bitbucket for source code while we'll use Github).  If possible, use the tools we've asked you to install on the [Mac Setup page](setup.html). If this causes confusion, let me know and I'll assist.
