* Th = Thursday, on which content may be light.  Need to allow for spillover from previous days.
* ; = Mini-Assignment (w/ break) will occur at this point in the lecture
* * = This portion of the lecture will be a full walkthrough of an example.

## Notes

* Once I introduce Testing, it will continue throughout
* Once I introduce Heroku, deployment will continue throughout

## Assignments

Most assignments will require students to build programs from scratch.  However, at least some will take each of these formats:

* Build a program to satisfy an existing test suite
* Assign issues/new features on an existing codebase
* Refactor under test
* Add tests to an existing (messy) codebase
* Write an application with team members from other classes (Python or Front End)

Also, I hope that many weekend assignments will be done in pairs.
