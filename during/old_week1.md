## Wednesday

#### Lecture

* Homework review
* More on previous topics:
  * Control Flow: next, break, return, and exit (change the assignment to not lose a turn if you guess the same thing twice)
  * Ranges and how they were used in the assignment
* Example: Keep track of all the names in class.  Then get rid of duplicates.
* .each
* Set
* Hashes
* Example: Collect information like first name and last name for all students, then just display first name.
* Using data structures inside data structures (e.g. an array of hashes)
* Object Oriented Programming
  * What are objects?
    * State and behavior
    * State = instance variables
    * Behavior = methods
  * What are classes?
    * Blueprints for objects
* Example: Humans and cell phones.  See files in notes below.
* Encapsulation
* Duck typing
* require
* Example: [Albums and Artists](https://github.com/masonfmatthews/rails_assignments/tree/master/exercises/albums_and_artists)
* Default parameters
