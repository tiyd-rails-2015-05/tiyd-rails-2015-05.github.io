## Required Technical Exercises

We ask that you complete each of these exercises before the first day of class. They will ensure you're a step ahead and we can get to the good stuff quickly.

* Complete the first four levels of [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/).
* Complete the [Try Git walkthrough](https://try.github.io/).
* Read [this Treehouse blog post about command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics). When reading the article, go through all the exercises in the article.
* Work through [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a long undertaking and you could spend eight hours working on this. The author has a brash and possibly abrasive tone. The material is good, however.

## Optional Technical Resources

The following exercises are not required! However, if you find yourself struggling with the above, or if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources:

* [Ruby on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby)
* [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/)
* [Getting Started - Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)

## If you have a TON of time...

...then you can do [the Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.com) by Michael
Hartl. Although it doesn't go into depth on too many topics, it's a great
overview, it gets you coding, and the book is free to read online.

Please note, though, that he uses a few different development tools in the book
than we'll use in the class (he uses Cloud9 for writing code while we'll use
Atom; he uses Bitbucket for source code while we'll use Github).  If possible,
use the tools we've asked you to install on the [Mac Setup page](setup.html). If this causes
confusion, let me know and I'll assist.
